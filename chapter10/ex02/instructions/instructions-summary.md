## Your Tasks

In this lab, you create a derived class from a base class, and then use the derived class in a C++ program. The program should create two `Motorcycle` objects, and then set the Motorcycleâ€™s speed, accelerate the Motorcycle object, and check its sidecar status. Use the Vehicle and Automobile classes that you worked with earlier in this chapter as a guide.
