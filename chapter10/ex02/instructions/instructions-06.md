In the _MyMotorcycleClassProgram.cpp_, create two `Motorcycle` objects named `motorcycleOne` and `motorcycleTwo`. Set the `sidecar` value of `motorcycleOne` to `true` and the `sidecar` value of `motorcycleTwo` to `false`. Set `motorcycleOne`’s maximum speed to 90 and `motorcycleTwo`’s maximum speed to 85. Set `motorcycleOne`’s current speed to 65 and `motorcycleTwo`’s current speed to 60. Accelerate `motorcycleOne` by 30 mph, and accelerate `motorcycleTwo` by 20 mph. Print the current speed of `motorcycleOne` and `motorcycleTwo`.
