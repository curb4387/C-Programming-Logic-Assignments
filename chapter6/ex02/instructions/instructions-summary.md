## Your Tasks

In this lab, you use what you have learned about searching a array to find an exact match to complete a partially pre-written C++ program. The program uses a array that contains valid names for 10 cities in Michigan. You ask the user of the program to enter a city name; your program then searches the array for that city name. If it is not found, the program should print a message that informs the user the city name is not found in the array of valid cities in Michigan.

The program provided for this lab includes the input statements and the necessary variable initializations. You need to use a loop to examine all the items in the array and test for a match. You also need to set a flag if there is a match and then test the flag variable to determine if you should print the **Not a city in Michigan** message or **City found** message. Comments in the code tell you where to write your statements. You can use the _Mail Order_ program in this chapter as a guide.
