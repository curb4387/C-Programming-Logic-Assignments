## Your Tasks

In this lab, you complete a partially pre-written C++ program that uses a array. The program prompts the user to interactively enter eight batting averages, which the program stores in a array. It should then find the minimum and maximum batting averages stored in the array, as well as the average of the eight batting averages. The data file provided for this lab includes the input statement and some variable initializations. Comments are included in the file to help you write the remainder of the program.

## Instructions

**Task 1**: Write the C++ statements as indicated by the comments.

An example of the program is shown below:

```
Enter a batting average: .299
Enter a batting average: .157
Enter a batting average: .242
Enter a batting average: .203
Enter a batting average: .198
Enter a batting average: .333
Enter a batting average: .270
Enter a batting average: .190
averages[0] is: 0.299
averages[1] is: 0.157
averages[2] is: 0.242
averages[3] is: 0.203
averages[4] is: 0.198
averages[5] is: 0.333
averages[6] is: 0.27
averages[7] is: 0.19
Minimum batting average is 0.157
Maximum batting average is 0.333
Average batting average is 0.2365
