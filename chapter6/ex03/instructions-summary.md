## Your Tasks

In this lab, you use what you have learned about parallel arrays to complete a partially completed C++ program. The program is described in _Chapter 6, Exercise 7_. The program should either print the name and price for a coffee add-in from the Jumpinâ€™ Jive coffee shop or it should print the message **Sorry, we do not carry that**. Read the problem description carefully before you begin. The program provided for this lab includes the necessary variable initializations and input statements. You need to write the part of the program that searches for the name of the coffee add-in(s) and either prints the name and price of the add-in or prints the error message, if the add-in is not found.

## Instructions

**Task 1**: Write the code that searches the array for the name of the add-in ordered by the customer.

**Task 2**: Write the code that prints the name and price of the add-in or the error message and also write the code that prints the total order cost.

Examples of the program are shown below:

```
Enter coffee add-in or XXX to quit: Cream
Cream price is $0.89
Enter coffee add-in or XXX to quit: XXX
Order Total is $2.89

```

```
Enter coffee add-in or XXX to quit: mayonnaise
Sorry we do not carry that.
Enter coffee add-in or XXX to quit: XXX
Order Total is $2.00

```
