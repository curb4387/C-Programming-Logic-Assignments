## Your Tasks

In this lab, you work with the same C++ program you worked with in _Lab 5-1_. As in _Lab 5-1_, the completed program should print the numbers 0 through 10, along with their values multiplied by 2 and by 10. However, in this lab, you should accomplish this using a `for` loop instead of a counter-controlled `while` loop.
