## Your Tasks

In this lab, you work with the same C++ program you worked with in _Lab 5-1_ and _Lab 5-3_. As in those earlier labs, the completed program should print the numbers 0 through 10, along with their values multiplied by 2 and by 10. However, in this lab, you should accomplish this using a `do...while` loop.
