## Your Tasks

In this lab, you add nested loops to a C++ program provided. The program should print the letter _E_, as shown below. The letter E is printed using asterisks, three across and five down. Note this program uses `cout << "*";` to print an asterisk and `cout << " ";` to print a space.

## Instructions

**Task 1**: Write the nested loops to control the number of rows and the number of columns that make up the letter _E_.

**Task 2**: In the loop body, use a nested `if` statement to decide when to print an asterisk and when to print a space. The output statements have been written, but you must decide when and where to use them.

An example of the program is shown below:
