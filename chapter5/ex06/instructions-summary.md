## Your Tasks

In this lab, you add a loop and the statements that make up the loop body to a C++ program provided. When completed, the program should calculate two totals: the number of left-handed people and the number of right-handed people in your class. Your loop should execute until the user enters the character **X** instead of an **L** for left-handed or an **R** for right-handed.

## Instructions

**Task 1**: Write a loop and a loop body that allow you to calculate a total of left-handed and right-handed people in your class.

**Task 2**: The program displays the correct totals for the **L** and **R** entered.

An example of the program is shown below:

```
Enter an L if you are left-handed, an R if you are right-handed or X to quit: R
Enter an L if you are left-handed, an R if you are right-handed or X to quit: R
Enter an L if you are left-handed, an R if you are right-handed or X to quit: R
Enter an L if you are left-handed, an R if you are right-handed or X to quit: L
Enter an L if you are left-handed, an R if you are right-handed or X to quit: L
Enter an L if you are left-handed, an R if you are right-handed or X to quit: L
Enter an L if you are left-handed, an R if you are right-handed or X to quit: R
Enter an L if you are left-handed, an R if you are right-handed or X to quit: L
Enter an L if you are left-handed, an R if you are right-handed or X to quit: R
Enter an L if you are left-handed, an R if you are right-handed or X to quit: R
Enter an L if you are left-handed, an R if you are right-handed or X to quit: L
Enter an L if you are left-handed, an R if you are right-handed or X to quit: X
Number of left-handed students: 5
Number of right-handed students: 6
