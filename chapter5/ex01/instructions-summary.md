## Your Tasks

In this lab, you use a counter-controlled `while` loop in a C++ program provided for you. When completed, the program should print the numbers 0 through 10, along with their values multiplied by 2 and by 10. The data file contains the necessary variable declarations and some output statements.

## Instructions

**Task 1**: Write a counter-controlled `while` loop that uses the loop control variable to take on the values 0 through 10. Remember to initialize the loop control variable before the program enters the loop.

**Task 2**: In the body of the loop, multiply the value of the loop control variable by 2 and by 10. Remember to change the value of the loop control variable in the body of the loop. Display the result of the multiplication during each loop.

An example of the program is shown below:

```
