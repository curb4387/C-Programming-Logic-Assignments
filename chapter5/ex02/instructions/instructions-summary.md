## Your Tasks

In this lab, you write a while loop that uses a sentinel value to control a loop in a C++ program. You also write the statements that make up the body of the loop. The source code file already contains the necessary variable declarations and output statements. You designed this program for the Hollywood Movie Rating Guide in _Chapter 5, Exercise 15_. Each theater patron enters a value from **0** to **4** indicating the number of stars the patron awards to the Guideâ€™s featured movie of the week. The program executes continuously until the theater manager enters a negative number to quit. At the end of the program, you should display the average star rating for the movie
