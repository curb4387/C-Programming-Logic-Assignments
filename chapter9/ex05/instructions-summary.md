## Your Tasks

In this lab, you complete a partially written C++ program that reverses the order of five numbers stored in an array. The program should first print the five numbers stored in the array. Next, the program passes the array to a function where the numbers are reversed. Finally, the main program should print the reversed numbers.
The source code file provided for this lab includes the necessary variable initializations. Comments are included in the file to help you write the remainder of the program

## Instructions

**Task 1**: Write the `reverseArray()` method to reverse the order of the numbers in the array.

An example of the program is shown below:

```
Original contents of array:
9
8
7
6
5
Reversed contents of array:
5
6
7
8
9
```
