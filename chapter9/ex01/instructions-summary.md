## Your Tasks

In this lab, you complete a partially pre-written C++ program that includes a function with no parameters.

The program asks the user if they have preregistered for art show tickets. If the user has preregistered, the program should call a function named `discount()` that displays the message **"You are pre-registered and qualify for a 5% discount."** If the user has not preregistered, the program should call a function named `noDiscount()` that displays the message **"Sorry, you did not pre-register and do not qualify for a 5% discount."**

The source code file provided for this lab includes the necessary variable declarations and `input` statement. Comments are included in the file to help you write the remainder of the program.

## Instructions

Write the C++ statements as indicated by the comments.

**Task 1**: Define the `discount()` method and implement the body that displays the message **"You are pre-registered and qualify for a 5% discount."**.

**Task 2**: Define the `noDiscount()` method and implement the body that displays the message **"Sorry, you did not pre-register and do not qualify for a 5% discount."**.

**Task 3**: The _ArtShowDiscount_ program compiles and works as expected.

An example of the program is shown below:

```
Did you preregister? Enter Y or N: Y
You are pre-registered and qualify for a 5% discount.
```
