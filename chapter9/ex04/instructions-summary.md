## Your Tasks

In this lab, you complete a partially written C++ program that includes a function that returns a value. The program is a simple calculator that prompts the user for two numbers and an operator (+, â€“, \*, /, or %). The two numbers and the operator are passed to the function where the appropriate arithmetic operation is
performed. The result is then returned to the `main()` function where the arithmetic operation and result are displayed. For example, if the user enters **3**, **4**, and **\***, the following is displayed:

```
3.00
 *
4.00
 =
12.00
```

The source code file provided for this lab includes the necessary variable initializations and input and output statements. Comments are included in the file to help you write the remainder of the program

## Instructions

**Task 1**: Write the `performOperation()` method that accepts two numbers and an operand as arguments and returns the result.

**Task 2**: The program accepts two numbers and an operand from the user and displays the result.

An example of the program is shown below:

```
Enter the first number: 4
Enter the second number: 4
Enter an operator (+.-.*,/,%): *
4.00
 *
4.00
 =
16.00
```
