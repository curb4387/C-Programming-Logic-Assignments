## Your Tasks

In this lab, you complete a partially written C++ program that includes a function named `multiplyNumbers()` that multiplies two `int` values to find their product. Three `int` values should be passed to the `multiplyNumbers()` function, the two numbers to be multiplied (`num1` and `num2`) should be passed by value, and another `int` (product) to hold the product of the two numbers should be passed by reference, enabling the `multiplyNumbers()` function to change its value.

The source code file provided for this lab includes the necessary variable declarations and input and output statements. Comments are included in the file to help you write the remainder of the program.

## Instructions

Open the source code file named _MultiplyTwo.cpp_.

**Task 1**: Write the `multiplyNumbers()` function, the function declaration, and the function call as indicated by the comments.

Open the source code file named _MultiplyTwo2.cpp_. Copy in your code from _MultiplyTwo.cpp_.

**Task 2**: Rewrite the `multiplyNumbers()` function to pass the two numbers (`num1` and `num2`) by value and to pass `product` by address.

An example of the program is show below:

```
Value of product is: 0
10 * 20 is 200
```
