## Your Tasks

In this lab, you complete a pre-written C++ program for a carpenter who creates personalized house signs. The program is supposed to compute the price of any sign a customer orders, based on the following facts:

- The charge for all signs is a minimum of $35.00.
- The first five letters or numbers are included in the minimum charge; there is a $4 charge
  for each additional character.
- If the sign is made of oak, add $20.00. No charge is added for pine.
- Black or white characters are included in the minimum charge; there is an additional $15
  charge for gold-leaf lettering.

## Instructions

**Task 1:** You need to declare variables for the following, and initialize them where specified:

- A variable (`charge`) for the cost of the sign initialized to 0.00.
- A variable (`numChars`) for the number of characters initialized to 8.
- A variable (`color`) for the color of the characters initialized to "gold".
- A variable (`woodType`) for the wood type initialized to "oak".

**Task 2** Write the rest of the program using assignment statements and `if` statements as
appropriate. The output statements are written for you.

An example of the program is shown below:

```
The charge for this sign is $82
