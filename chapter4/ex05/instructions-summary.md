## Your Tasks

In this lab, you complete a partially written C++ program for an airline that offers a 25 percent discount to passengers who are 6 years old or younger and the same discount to passengers who are 65 years old or older. The program should request a passengerâ€™s name and age and then print whether the passenger is eligible or not eligible for a discount.

## Instructions

Variables have been declared and initialized for you, and the input statements have been written. Read them carefully before you proceed to the next step

**Task 1**: Design the logic deciding whether to use AND or OR logic. Write the decision statement to identify when a discount should be offered and when a discount should not be offered.

**Task 2**: Include output statements telling whether or not the customer is eligible for a discount.

> If the customer is eligible, be sure to include **is eligible** in the program's output. If the customer is not eligible, be sure to include **is not eligible** in the program's output.
