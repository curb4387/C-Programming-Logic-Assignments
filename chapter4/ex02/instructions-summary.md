## Your Tasks

In this lab, you complete a pre-written C++ program that computes the largest and smallest of three integer values. The three values are -50, 53, 78.

## Instructions

Two variables named `largest` and `smallest` are declared for you. Use these variables to store the largest and smallest of the three integer values. Three variables have been declared for you `firstNumber`, `secondNumber`, `thirdNumber`. You must decide what other variables you will need and initialize them as appropriate.

**Task 1:** Write the rest of the program using assignment statements, if statements, or if else statements as appropriate. There are comments in the code that tell you where you should write your statements.The output statements are written for you.

An example of the program is shown below:

```
The largest value is 78

The smallest value is -50
