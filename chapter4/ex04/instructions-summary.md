## Your Tasks

In this lab, you complete a pre-written C++ program that calculates an employee’s end-of-year bonus and prints the employee’s name, yearly salary, performance rating, and bonus. In this program, bonuses are calculated based on employees’ annual salary and their performance rating. The rating system is contained in **Table 4-5**.

| Rating | Bonus                       |
| ------ | --------------------------- |
| 1      | 25 percent of annual salary |
| 2      | 15 percent of annual salary |
| 3      | 10 percent of annual salary |
| 4      | None                        |

## Instructions

Variables have been declared for you, and the input statements and output statements have been written. Read them over carefully before you proceed to the next step.

**Task 1**: Design the logic, and write the rest of the program using a `switch` statement.

Execute the program entering the following as input:

```
Employee’s name: Jeanne Hanson
Employee’s salary: 70000.00
Employee’s performance rating: 2
```

Confirm that your output matches the following:

```
