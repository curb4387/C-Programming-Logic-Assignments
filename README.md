EICC Fall 2024 Intro to Programming Logic: C++ Coding Assignments

This repo has all coding exercises that I completed for my 8-week class: Introduction to Programming Logic. It also includes chapter 7-8 which we did not go over. These coding exercises were done with C++, but were also available in Python and Java. Throughout the rest of the year, I will reorganize the subdirectories, and include Python code. (Java code may come in the future.)
