## Your Tasks

In this lab, you will complete a C++ program that uses an array to store data for the village of Marengo. The program is described in _Chapter 8, Exercise 5_. The program should allow the user to enter each household size and determine the mean and median household size in Marengo. The program should output the mean and median household size in Marengo. The file provided for this lab contains the necessary variable initializations and input statements. You need to write the code that sorts the household sizes in ascending order using a bubble sort and then prints the mean and median household size in Marengo. Comments in the code tell you where to write your statements.

## Instructions

**Task 1**: Write the bubble sort and output the mean and median household size in Marengo.

An example of the program is shown below:

```
Enter household size or 999 to quit: 4
Enter household size or 999 to quit: 1
Enter household size or 999 to quit: 2
Enter household size or 999 to quit: 4
Enter household size or 999 to quit: 3
Enter household size or 999 to quit: 3
Enter household size or 999 to quit: 2
Enter household size or 999 to quit: 2
Enter household size or 999 to quit: 2
Enter household size or 999 to quit: 4
Enter household size or 999 to quit: 5
Enter household size or 999 to quit: 6
Enter household size or 999 to quit: 999
Mean household size in Marengo is : 3.1666666666666665
Median household size in Marengo is : 3.0
