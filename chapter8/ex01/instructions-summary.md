## Your Tasks

In this lab, you will complete a C++ program that swaps values stored in three `int` variables and determines maximum and minimum values. The C++ file provided for this lab contains the necessary variable initializations, as well as the input and output statements. You want to end up with the smallest value stored in the variable named `first` and the largest value stored in the variable named `third`. You need to write statements that compare the values and swap them, if appropriate. Comments included in the code tell you where to write your statements

## Instructions

Write the statements that test the first two integers and swap them, if necessary.

Write the statements that test the second and third integer and swap them, if necessary.

Write the statements that test the first and second integers again and swap them, if necessary.

**Task 1:** Execute the program using the following sets of input values:

```
101 22 â€“23
630 1500 9
21 2 2
```

An example of the program is shown below:

```
Enter first number: 101
Enter second number: 22
Enter third number: -23
Smallest: -23
Next largest: 22
Largest: 101
```
