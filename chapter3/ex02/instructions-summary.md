## Your Tasks

In this lab, you add the input and output statements to a partially completed C++ program. When completed, the user should be able to enter a year, a month, and a day. The program then determines if the date is valid. Valid years are those that are greater than 0, valid months include the values 1 through 12, and valid days include the values 1 through 31.

## Instructions

_Note: Variables have been declared for you._

**Task 1**: Write the simulated `housekeeping()` function that contains the prompts and input statements to retrieve a year, a month, and a day from the user. Include the output statements in the simulated `endOfJob()` function.

The format of the output is as follows:

```
month/day/year is a valid date.
```

or

```
month/day/year is an invalid date.
```

The rest of the program is written for you.

Execute the program entering the following:

```
month = 5, day = 32, year = 2014.
```

and

```
month = 9, day = 21, year = 2002.
```

An example of the program is shown below:

```
Enter year: 2002
Enter month: 9
Enter day: 21
9/21/2002 is a valid date.
```
