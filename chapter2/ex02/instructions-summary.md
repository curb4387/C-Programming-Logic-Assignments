## Your Tasks

In this lab, you declare and initialize constants in a C++ program. The program, which is in a file named **NewAge2.cpp**, calculates your age in the year 2050. 

Use the copy code button below to bring over your code from the previous exercise.
## Instructions

**Task 1:** Declare a constant named `YEAR`, and initialize `YEAR` with the value **2050**.

**Task 2:** Edit the statement `myNewAge = myCurrentAge + (2050 âˆ’ currentYear)` so it uses the constant named `YEAR`.

**Task 3:** Edit the statement `cout << "I will be " << myNewAge << " in 2050." << endl;` so it uses the constant named `YEAR`.

**Task 4:** All instances of inline, hard-coded `2050` have been replaced with the `YEAR` constant.

An example of the program is shown below:

```
My Current Age is 29
I will be 65 in 2050.
```
