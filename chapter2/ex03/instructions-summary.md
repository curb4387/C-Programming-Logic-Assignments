## Your Tasks

In this lab, you complete a partially written C++ program that is provided for you. The program, which was written for a furniture company, prints the name of the furniture item, its retail price, its wholesale price, the profit made on the piece of furniture, a sale price, and the profit made when the sale price is used.

## Instructions

Design the logic and write the C++ code that will use assignment statements to:

**Task 1:** Calculate the profit (`profit`) as the retail price minus the wholesale price.

**Task 2:** Calculate the sale price (`salePrice`) as 25 percent deducted from the retail price.

**Task 3:** Calculate the sale profit (`saleProfit`) as the sale price minus the wholesale price.

An example of the program is shown below:

```
Item Name: TV Stand
Retail Price: $325
Wholesale Price: $200
Profit: $125
Sale Price: $243.75
Sale Profit: $43.75
```
