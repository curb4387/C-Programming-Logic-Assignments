The program output includes state tax with-held, federal tax withheld, dependent tax deductions, salary, and take-home pay.

## Instructions

Write the C++ code needed to perform the following:

_Note: There is no need to round to two decimal places in this exercise._

**Task 1:** Calculate state withholding tax at 6.5 percent, and calculate federal withholding tax at 28.0.

_Note: 6.5 percent is 0.065 when performing calculations._
